 Studying patterns that determine the success of games/Изучение закономерностей, определяющих успешность игр



Using historical data on computer game sales, user and expert reviews, genres, and platforms to identify patterns that determine a game's success.

Parameters defining a game's success in different global regions were discovered. Based on this, 
a report was prepared for a computer game store to plan advertising campaigns. 
Data preprocessing and analysis were conducted. A relevant period was chosen for analysis. User profiles for each region were created.
Hypotheses were tested: whether the average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same, 
and whether the average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different.
The analysis employed the Student's t-test for independent samples.
